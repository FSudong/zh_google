HARP: Hierarchical Representation Learning for Networks
Abstract:Abstract:  We present HARP, a novel method for learning low dimensional embeddings of a graph's nodes which preserves higher-order structural features. Our proposed method achieves this by compressing the input graph prior to embedding i...
