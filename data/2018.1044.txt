Hierarchical Gated Recurrent Neural Tensor Network for Answer Triggering
Abstract:In this paper, we focus on the problem of answer triggering ad-dressed by Yang et al. (2015), which is a critical component for a real-world question answering system. We employ a hierarchical gated recurrent neural tensor (HGRNT) model ...
