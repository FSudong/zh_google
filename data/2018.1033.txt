Effective Deep Memory Networks for Distant Supervised Relation Extraction
Abstract:Abstract Distant supervised relation extraction (RE) has been an effective way of finding novel relational facts from text without labeled training data. Typically it can be formalized as a multi-instance multi-label problem.In this pape...
